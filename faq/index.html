        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q1. Who can see my spawned in items?</h2>
            <p>A1. Anyone in your lobby can see them, and in the trade window. No one will see them in Private Matches or Casual / Competitive Playlists, including you.</p>
        </div>

<div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q2. What happens if I try to trade my spawned in items?</h2>
            <p>A2. The trade will timeout and will not go through. Additionally, everything you‚Äôve spawned in will be removed from your inventory, so you‚Äôll have to respawn them in.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q3. Do I keep my spawned in items after closing Rocket League?</h2>
            <p>A3. At the time of writing, no. Once you close and reopen Rocket League and Voltage, you‚Äôll have to spawn everything in again. Crunchy plans to add this at a later date.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q4. Can you spawn in Credits / Blueprints and buy stuff / build items from them?</h2>
            <p>A4. You can spawn in credits but you won‚Äôt be able to purchase anything. At the time of writing, that hasn‚Äôt been confirmed for Blueprints, but it probably doesn‚Äôt work either.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q5. Can anyone see my custom titles, or any titles I spawned in (like the RLCS ones)?</h2>
            <p>A5. No one else can see custom or spawned in titles. However, if you buy a DLC that Voltage offer, other Voltage users will be able to view the titles (i.e. the Paid Titles).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q6. Can I spawn in DLC cars (or any cars like a Fennec) that I previously do not own and use them?</h2>
            <p>A6. Yes, you can spawn them in. However, you won‚Äôt be able to use them in Casual, Competitive or Private Matches. They work in training and Exhibition games though.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q8. I want to flex my spawned in items in a trade window. Why can't the player I‚Äôm trading with see some of them?</h2>
            <p>A8. Only items you‚Äôve equipped can be seen in the trade window at the other player‚Äôs end. If, for example, you wanted to flex an Octane Set, when you spawn in the Set, just press ‚ÄúEquip Now‚Äù to all the Octanes. It should work then.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q9. Why does Voltage occasionally crash?</h2>
            <p>A9. Everyones computer is different, the developer might never experience any crashes, so they have trouble finding the cause of them. Just keep checking ‚Å†download for the newest Voltage.dll file.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q10. Can I use my Voltage purchase on any other alt accounts?</h2>
            <p>A10. No. There is an account verification stage after you purchase Voltage. You could try contact Crunchy directly if you really wanted to, but she probably won‚Äôt anyways.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q12. I‚Äôm still having trouble installing Voltage. Help!</h2>
            <p>A12. ‚Å†old-download</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q13. I‚Äôve been told that deleting the Voltage folder can help reduce the crashes. Where the heck is it?</h2>
            <p>A13. If you‚Äôre on Steam: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\Voltage</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q14. How do I find the list of Item ID‚Äôs?</h2>
            <p>A14. On the Voltage GUI, under the ‚ÄúItems‚Äù section, click the button "Save Item List To File", and then press ‚ÄúOpen Voltage Folder‚Äù. Once there, open the ‚Äúitems‚Äù file using Notepad. Now, simply press ‚ÄúControl F‚Äù to find what you‚Äôre looking for! Personally, I‚Äôd recommend creating a shortcut to this file on your desktop to avoid having to go through this procedure every time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q15: I‚Äôm being told I‚Äôve downloaded a virus. The heck am I supposed to do now?!?!?</h2>
            <p>A15: Depending on your antivirus software, the steps may vary. Head over to ‚Å†üö©ÔΩúsupport for any queries. From my personal experience, however, Voltage is pretty safe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q16. Can I do trade-ups when I spawn in items?</h2>
            <p>A16. Trade-ups are not supported by Voltage as of now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q17: Which drops can I open?</h2>
            <p>A17: The following are currently supported on Voltage:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>- Black Market Drops</h2>
            <p>- Exotic Drops</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q18. I‚Äôve tried everything and Voltage just won‚Äôt work! Any help???</h2>
            <p>A18: Try the following. If Voltage is crashing, refer to Q9. If this doesn‚Äôt help, contact us in ‚Å†üö©ÔΩúsupport </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q19. I‚Äôm trying to open my Drops and it just says, ‚ÄúInventory out of sync‚Äù. How do I stop this?</h2>
            <p>A19. In the ‚ÄúPsynet Traffic‚Äù tab, you‚Äôll have to enable "traffic intercepting‚Äù. Once done, restart Rocket League and inject the DLL when the ‚ÄúRocket League Season 9‚Äù logo shows up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q20. How do I switch my ID that I have authorized?</h2>
            <p>A20. In the ‚Å†ü™™ÔΩúuser-ids channel, using the variable key at the bottom of the message, type</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q21. My game is crashing?</h2>
            <p>A21. Using Bakkes Mod with Voltage can cause crashes. Any features related to custom textures (Custom Avatar, Banner, Balls), all require a specific 32bit 500x500 PNG file with a specific name. If you don't know how to set that up, I recommend you dont use custom textures for now.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q22. When I put spawned items in the trade window, why does the trade cancel?</h2>
            <p>A22. You must equip the items that you want to trade, while you are in the party with the person that you are trading.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q23. Why does Voltage give me this error: "Recv failure: connection was reset"?</h2>
            <p>A23. this is a new issue with some specific ISP, to fix it, simply turn on a VPN.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q24. When will items be visible in-game on my end?</h2>
            <p>A24. The answer is related to Q7 but PLEASE STOP ASKING US, THE FEATURE MAY COME AT A LATER DATE, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY ASKED SO PLEASE LEAVE US IN PEACE!!!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q25. Why do I get a none item, then a grey screen that hard locks the game?</h2>
            <p>A25. This error means that your save file is corrupt. Go to Documents/My Games/Rocket League/TAGame/SaveData/DBE_Production/</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q26. I set my preset to black, now I can't revert it.</h2>
            <p>A26. ‚Å†hit the default color button lmao</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q27. I installed the auto injector and it says it injected, but nothing happened? or I am trying to access the download page at voltage.gay/DLLs/Voltage.dll and it says there is an issue reaching the website?</h2>
            <p>A27. This is due to restrictions from your ISP, as some of the packing software used on Voltage can commonly be associated with viruses, though this is not the case. To get around this, you can use a VPN, or attempt to contact your ISP.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>Q28. My ID is authorized but I keep getting an error that looks like this, how do I fix it?</h2>
            <p>A28. Use a VPN.</p>
